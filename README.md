# Siletz_Omykiss_2023
# Objective: Use GT-seq to characterize genotypic frequencies at markers associated with anadromous - resident phenotypes (i.e., Omy5 on chromosome 5) and return timing (ie.e, Omy28 on chromosome 28) phenotypes in rainbow/steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sampled from Valsetz Falls in the Siletz River by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW).  
# Sampling: 291 fin clips were sampled June 21st 2022 - November 4th 2022 from O. mykiss with presumed natural origin. 
# Genotyped with the SFGL GT-seq SOP, Omy_391_probe_seqs.csv probe seq file, and OmySEX_test_v3.pl. Quality filtered according to SFGL SOP. 
# metadata: Sampling dates, SFGL intake form
